# Face Recognition With MTCNN And Facenet
Personal project for ``CourseWork 2`` in AI4E course.

## About the dataset

Videos containing faces of many people at different angles. 

This project dataset includes videos from 14 people so there are 14 target classes: ['Duc', 'HDuc', 'Hieu', 'Hung', 'Kien', 'Linh', 'Quan', 'Tan', 'Thang'
            ,'Truong', 'Tuan', 'Van', 'VietDuc', 'XuanAnh']
            
Run ``extract_img_from_video.py`` to save images capturing from videos to folders which belong to each class using ``cv2.captureVideo()`` of ``OpenCV`` library. Each folder includes 50 images. All results are saved in ``raw_images`` folder for preprocessing steps before feeding to neural networks.

```
python extract_img_from_video.py
```

## MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)

The MTCNN model consists of 3 separate networks: ``P-Net``, ``R-Net``, ``O-Net``.

### P-net (Proposal Network)

P-Net is used to obtain potential windows and their bounding box regression vectors (coordinates). After that, we employ
non-maximum suppression (NMS) to merge highly overlapped candidates.

### R-net (Refine Network)

The R-net (Refine Network) performs the same steps as the P-net. However, the network still uses a method called padding, assuming the insertion of zero pixels into the missing parts of the bounding box if the bounding box is limit exceeded too compile of image. All bounding boxes will now be resized to 24x24 size, treated as 1 kernel and fed into the R-net. which further rejects a large number of false candidates, performs calibration with bounding box regression, and NMS candidate merge.

### O-net (Output Network)

This stage is similar to the second stage, but in this stage we aim to describe the face in more details. In particular,
the network will output five facial landmarks’ positions which include 4 coordinates of bounding box (out[0]), coordinates of 5 landmark points on the face, including 2 eyes, 1 nose, 2 sides of lips (out[1]) and confidence point of each box (out[2] ). All will be saved into a dictionary with the 3 keys mentioned above. For example:
```sh
{'box': [564, 118, 209, 212], 'confidence': 0.9637771248817444, 'keypoints': {'left_eye': (620, 184), 'right_eye': (718, 180), 'nose': (670, 191), 'mouth_left': (632, 267), 'mouth_right': (714, 266)}}
```

## Facenet

``Embedding Vector:`` A fixed-size vector (often smaller in dimension than normal Feature Vectors), learned during training, and represents a set of features responsible for classifying features in space time. was changed.

``Base Network:`` A convolutional neural network which inputs are images and outputs are embedding vectors containing the features of face of input images. In this repo, we use ``Inceptionresnetv2`` as base network which outputs are 128-dimension embedding vectors. Base Network implementation is showed in ``facenet_artchitecture.py``.

``Triplet Loss:`` Triplet Loss introduces a new formula that includes 3 input values including:
- ``Anchor:`` $x_i^{a}$: Output image of neuron network.
- ``Positive`` $x_i^{p}$: The image of the same person as the anchor.
- ``Negative`` $x_i^{n}$: The image is not the same person as the anchor.

The triplot loss function always takes 3 images as input and in all cases we expect:

$$ || f\left(x_i^{a}\right)-f\left(x_i^{p}\right) ||^{2} + \alpha < || f\left(x_i^{a}\right)-f\left(x_i^{n}\right) ||^{2} $$
            
$||$ is Euclidean, $f\left(x_i^{a}\right)$ is the embedding vector of x_i^{a}.

Loss function proposed in original paper:

$$L = \sum \limits^{N}_{i} \left[ || f\left(x_i^{a}\right)-f\left(x_i^{p}\right) ||^{2}- || f\left(x_i^{a}\right)-f\left(x_i^{n}\right) ||^{2}+\alpha\right]$$

## Overall Pipeline 

- Extract frames from original videos and save results in raw_images folder by running ``extract_img_from_video.py``.

- Display some random images from raw_images folder after feeding to MTCNN by running   ``display_images.py``.

- Resize images to ``160x160`` shape to match with input shape of Base Network in this repo, train_test split and save train, test images to folders by running ``preprocessing.py``.

- Load dataset by running ``load.py``, dataset is saved in ``faces-dataset.npz``.

- Feed to facenet and extract embedding vectors by running ``create_embedding.py``. Embedding vectors are saved in ``face-dataset-embedding.npz``.

- Train embedding vectors with ``SVM`` classifier by running ``train.py``.

- Predict samples by running ``predict_samples.py``.

## Note
To test with new images, create folder containings all new images, changes link to this new folder and run ``load.py``. After that, run  ``predict_samples.py`` to get prediction for new images.
